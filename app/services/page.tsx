          my experience is in leading a team of engineers to think
          comprehensively and adversarially enough about a codebase, protocol,
          or mental model that we notice the gaps in the armor. then we'd fill
          them in with automation, testing, new mechanisms, or even redesigns if
          necessary. i also just like writing code in general :)

          end-to-end specification or review of the on/offchain, financial,
          game-theoretic, and MEV aspects of web3 protocols. tell me what you
          want at the highest level and i'll specify or break your system.

          estimating/modeling the risks of high-stakes decisions (even seemingly
          non-quantifiable ones), finding shaky assumptions hidden in plain
          sight, and designing cheap experiments that drastically reduce
          uncertainty.
