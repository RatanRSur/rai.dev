                If it involves programming and hardware, I love it! These are the things I've been working on recently:
                <br>
                <ul>
                        <li><a target="_blank" href="http://tactilecity.org"><em>Tactile City</em></a> is a proposal made to the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities upon request by the Department of Design and Construction. The team consisted of architects, artists and an engineer (me). In addition to brainstorming, my role was to prototype the electronics associated with the audio portion of our proposal. The system is a reactive sound box which self adjusts it's volume according to the ambient noise. The effect was acheived through a combination of passive circuit components, such as capacitors, and a Python script loaded onto a Raspberry Pi. The Pi was chosen for ease of prototyping, however, moving forward, a clear winner in terms of power management would be a small Arduino with a shield designed for audio playback. I'm very proud of the proposal even beyond the electronics portion, so please take a look at the website!</li>
                        <li><a target="_blank" href="http://hackCooper.org"><em>HackCooper</em></a> is an annual hackathon organized by us at create@cooper and hosted at The Cooper Union. This <span style="color:hotpink">Valentine's Day</span> was the second one. Last year, a considerable proportion of the hacks were hardware hacks and I really want to double down on that this year. I think most students would enjoy staying up 24 hours building a funny robot more than they would the thousandth geotagging-social-sharing app.

                                <li> <a target="_blank" href="http://yorgo.org">Yorgo Alexopolous</a> is an artist I programmed for during the semester. The project I was working on involved a ton of cute hobbyist displays controlled by Raspberry Pi's and Arduinos. Some of the displays cycle through some pretty straightforward animations. Others would require a lot of thought to get a sense of what they're up to. He gave me a lot of creative freedom so I chose to find my inspiration in some lesser known mathematical patterns , such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral">The Ulam Spiral</a>

                                        <li>In the summertime I worked with openCV, a library of computer vision functions in C++, to create and improve edge detection algorithms for InfoInnovation. The algorithms were for use in prosthesis prototyping so the main issues were differentiation between the border of the hand and interior edges, accurate flesh detection and accurate finger detection.
