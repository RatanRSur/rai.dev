            <li> After I graduated, I spent my days learning to implement machine learning algorithms, keeping tabs on advances in the machine learning field and generally just thinking a lot about the nature of intelligence, artificial or human. It's really fun to notice things about the way humans think and try to find some way to apply that concept to artificial intelligence. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies"><i>Superintelligence</i></a> by Nick Bostrom was an extremely eye opening read.</li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tactilecity.org"><span style="color:#ff6700"><em>Tactile City</em></span></a> is a proposal made to the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities upon request by the Department of Design and Construction. The team consisted of architects, artists and an engineer (me). In addition to brainstorming, my role was to prototype the electronics associated with the audio portion of our proposal. The system is a reactive sound box which adjusts it's volume according to the ambient noise. The effect was acheived through a combination of passive circuit components, such as capacitors, and a Python script loaded onto a Raspberry Pi. The Pi was chosen for ease of prototyping, however, moving forward, a clear winner in terms of power management would be a small Arduino with a shield designed for audio playback. I'm very proud of the proposal even beyond the electronics portion, so please take a look at the website!</li>
            <li><a target="_blank" href="http://hackCooper.org"><em>HackCooper</em></a> is an annual hackathon organized by us at create@cooper and hosted at The Cooper Union. <span style="color:hotpink">Valentine's Day 2015</span> was the second one. In 2014's HackCooper, a considerable proportion of the hacks were hardware hacks and I really wanted to double down on that for 2015. I think most students would enjoy staying up 24 hours building a funny robot more than they would the thousandth geotagging-social-sharing app. Sure enough, we definitely saw a lot of hardware projects thanks in no small part to littleBit's beginner friendlyness and the allure of the Oculus Rifts provided by MLH.
